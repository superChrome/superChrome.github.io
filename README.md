Fire up a PC remove the bloatware if any or better and best do a clean install. The guys at edx suggest a 4 GB RAM would be awesome but I was able to get it all done in 2 GB as well.

To install EdX platform on ~~Ubuntu 12.04.4 Server~~ on a virtual machine running on Ubuntu Server

How To

```bash
sudo apt-get install virtualbox-qt
sudo apt-get install vagrant
